### Part 2: Customer Behavioural Analysis
#### Overview
[Kira Plastinina](https://kiraplastinina.ru/) is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.

Perform clustering stating insights drawn from your analysis and visualizations. Upon implementation, provide comparisons between the approaches learned this week i.e. K-Means clustering vs Hierarchical clustering highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach in the context of your analysis. Your findings should help inform the team in formulating the marketing and sales strategies of the brand.

You will create a Markdown which will comprise the following sections.
- Question Definition
- Metric of success
- Understanding the context
- Data Relevance
    - Loading the dataset
- Data Exploration
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Modelling
- Conclusions and Recommendations
